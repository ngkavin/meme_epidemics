# Analyzing the Spread of Memes with Epidemiological Models

## Abstract
Memes are elements of culture that have the potential to spread rapidly across the internet. Modeling how these memes propagate over time opens the door for interested parties to maximize the popularity and lifespan of memes in order to leverage them for political, financial, or other personal gain. This paper analyzes the claim that memes spread virally by fitting the SIR model, a model commonly discussed in epidemiological contexts, to real-world time series data on the popularity of internet memes. Analysis were performed on 6 memes with interest data on each meme acquired by Google Trends. The temporal dynamics of diseases were found to translate remarkably well to memes, indicating that memes are infectious in nature in a way similar to viruses.
